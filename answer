1) gitignore specifies which files are untracked and should be ignored by gitignore

2)Fast forwards means there is a straight path between the current brach to target branch ,
so git instead of merging each branch in a secquence it moves its pointers to the target branch.

3)having branches allows you to isolates your changes without having to edit the main.

4)ideally in a project you should have only 1 repository , however sometimes in largers projects 
you'll need more than one to manage the project efficiently.
